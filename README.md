### Hello there 👋 I'm Matthew Strumillo

I'm a passionate of low-level programming concepts and you can find me working as a Game Developer, a modder, or a guy that tries hard writing low-level optimized code for no real reason. I am a student of Computer Science at Łódź University of Technology.

And yes ... I am looking to collaborate 👯
